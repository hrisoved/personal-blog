text1: Hi, I’m Diana Hrisovescu — an innovator and entrepreneur with a background in Computer Science and Business, passionate about creating accessible, user-first digital experiences.

text2: I’m the founder of ScriptForms, a platform that has helped over 15,000 migrants in Ireland access public services more easily. I’ve led product design and development from the ground up and recently completed a Product Management internship at Microsoft, where I helped shape and communicate the value proposition of an internal engineering tool by improving how its potential impact was visualised and understood across teams.

text3: My work has been recognised by the Irish Independent and Business Post as part of their 30 Under 30 lists for young innovators and entrepreneurs. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Engineering, Science, and Technology Entrepreneurship Excellence (ESTEEM) at the University of Notre Dame as a Naughton Fellow, continuing my journey at the intersection of technology, impact, and design.
